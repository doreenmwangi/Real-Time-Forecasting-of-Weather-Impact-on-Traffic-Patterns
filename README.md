# Real-Time-Forecasting-of-Weather-Impact-on-Traffic-Patterns
This interdisciplinary group project investigates the relationship between weather and road traffic, aiming to improve traffic forecasting through data-driven insights. By integrating real-time weather data (e.g., temperature, rain, wind) with traffic metrics, we developed predictive models that forecast traffic flow under varying weather conditions. The outcome is a user-friendly web application that helps commuters, city planners, and transport companies visualize and respond to traffic conditions more effectively.

Key features include time series forecasting, real-time data integration, ethical model development, and practical deployment through a collaborative, cross-disciplinary approach.
